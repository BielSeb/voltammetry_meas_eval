# voltammetry_meas_eval

This code was created to help researchers in the field of Electrobiotechnology  to automate their measurement evaluations. The measurements are about **cyclic voltammetry**. 

### About
The task is to find the difference in current between the linear beginning of the data and the maximum. Thus, the approach is to fit the first values with a linear function and afterwards compute the difference to the maximum at the point of the maximum.

### Detailed Manual
He also wrote detailed instructions about how to use the script for their purposes. Have a closer look [here](MANUAL.pdf).
